## What is the best documentation rather than showing how to use a package?

Well this is a repository where I show how to use the package [GraphQL Fastify Server](https://github.com/rpvsilva/graphql-fastify-server). I wiil update this repo with every features added to the package to demonstrate them.

If you have any doubt or feature request please feel free to create an issue on the package repository.
